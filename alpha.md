# alpha

These are the list of features that give us a leg up imo.

## recipients govern allocation of assets as a group
* great narrative here and it doesn't take that much work to extend existing governance functionality to this stakeholder group

## nuanced governance of how the group can scale
* [docs](modules/meta/README.md)

## informative dilution-based graphics for voters on membership applications (UX)
