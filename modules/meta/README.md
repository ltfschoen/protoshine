* we could set an upper bound curve that decides the maximum allowed wealth gap for internal shares that decreases as the organization’s size grows. The mechanism could burn the wealthiest when/if the organization grows past a certain size and exceed the gap. 
* maybe using gini coefficient would be even better. Like whenever gini coefficient is sufficiently bad, the top percent are taxed more and that’s burned (and thereby redistributed to everyone)
